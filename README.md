👋 Hi there! I’m Sharavan Battula, an Automation Engineer with over 13 years of experience. I love connecting the dots between software development and testing to create seamless, efficient processes.

💡 What I Do: 

  • Automating the Boring Stuff: From UI automation with Playwright to API testing with Postman and Rest Assured, I make testing faster, smarter, and scalable. 
  • Breaking and Building: Helping teams create bug-free software with robust frameworks and CI/CD pipelines on AWS and Azure. 
  • Cloud Explorer: Dipping my toes into DevOps, ensuring testing and deployment feel like a breeze.

✨ Fun Facts About Me: 
  • I appreciate the elegance of code that tests other code
  • I enjoy mentoring manual testers and helping them become automation pros.
  • Sometimes, I automate just for the fun of it—because who doesn’t love a good challenge? 🚀

⚡ Current Mission: 
  • Exploring AI-driven testing tools to make testing future-proof. 
  • Sharing knowledge on Playwright, TypeScript, and test strategies.

📂 Featured Projects:
